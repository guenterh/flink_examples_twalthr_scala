# Flink API Examples for DataStream API and Table API implemented in Scala

Flink is now Scala Free. In the upcoming 1.15 release, Flink will not expose any specific Scala version.
Users can now choose whatever Scala version they need in their user code, including Scala 3.

This repository is a reimplementation of Timo Walther's [Flink API Examples for DataStream API and Table API](https://github.com/twalthr/flink-api-examples)
examples in Scala 2.13. 
You can watch his talk [Flink's Table & DataStream API: A Perfect Symbiosis](https://youtu.be/vLLn5PxF2Lw) on YouTube which walks through the Java version of this code.

All the examples for the presentation are implemented only in Java
